<p>Dear Ashley Chamberlain</p>

<p>Your current payment plan is coming to an end.</p>

<p>Total amount still owed: &pound;3960.00</p>

<p>It is now time for your payment plan review which you can do online by signing in to your account &ndash; this must be done by <b>31/12/2022</b></p>

<p>During the review, we will ask you questions about your income and expenditure to understand how much you can afford to pay and help you set up a new payment plan which works for you.</p>

<p>If you are able to increase your plan, further reviews may not be needed.</p>

<p>Next steps:</p>

<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
<li>Go to <a href="startThis">https://repay-manage-benefit-you-owe.service.gov.uk</a></li>
<li>Sign in to your account</li>
</ol>

<p>Alternatively, if you cannot go online, you can contact us on the number above to discuss further. If you don't do anything by 31/12/2022, we will either:

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>contact your employer, where you have one, to make deductions from your pay</li>
<li>ask a debt collection agency to collect this money for us</li>
</ul>
