<p>Dear Ashley Chamberlain</p>

<p>You owe outstanding amounts to DWP Debt Management.</p>

<p>Total amount owed: <b>&pound;4320.00</b></p>


<p>Our new online service means you can view a breakdown of what you owe and pay in a way that suits you, either by Direct Debit, flexible payments or pay the full amount.</p>

<p>Next steps:</p>

<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
<li>Go to <a href="startThis">https://repay-manage-benefit-you-owe.service.gov.uk</a></li>
<li><b>Enter security code 30054876254</b> &ndash; it is important to make a note of this as you may need it each time you sign in.</li>
<li>Enter your date of birth</li>
</ol>

<p>Alternatively, you can set up a Direct Debit by contacting us on the number above. If you don't do anything by <b>04/01/2022</b>, we will either:

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>contact your employer, where you have one, to make deductions from your pay</li>
<li>ask a debt collection agency to collect this money for us</li>
</ul>

<p>The amount we ask your employer to deduct will depend on what you earn and could be up to 20% of your earnings. However, if you have been prosecuted for a benefit fraud offence, this could rise to 40%.</p>

<p>Your employer may also charge you an administration fee; this will not exceed &pound;1 for each payment deducted from your earnings.</p>

<p>For help and support on dealing with debt and budgeting, contact:</p>
