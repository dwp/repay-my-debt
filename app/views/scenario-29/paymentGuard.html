   </span> How flexible payments work</h1>
 

 
 <p>Flexible payments work in the following way:</p>
 
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
   <li>your chosen payment amount of &pound;{{ data['affordable-amount'] }} will become your minimum monthly target</li>
   <li>you can make multiple payments in a month to either meet or pay more than your target &ndash; when you pay is up to you</li>

  <li>you can make low payments during difficult times but regular low payments mean we may contact you to discuss your situation</li>
  <li>you can contact us for help if you're struggling to pay</li>
   </ul>
  
<div class="govuk-inset-text">
  <p>You need to make a payment today to start your plan so have your card ready &ndash; credit card payments will incur extra charges, debit card payments will not.
  </p>
