<p>Dear Ashley Chamberlain</p>

<p>You owe outstanding amounts on a Universal Credit advance.</p>

<p>Total amount to pay: <b>£120</b></p>

<p>
Make faster payments online by card &ndash; pay your debt in full or make flexible payments each month based on what you can afford without setting up a fixed plan.</p>

<p>You need to contact us by <b>30/07/2020</b>.</p>

<p>Next steps:</p>

<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
<li>Go to <a href="start">https://www.gov.uk/repay-my-debt</a></li>
<li><b>Enter security code 30054876254 - make a note of this as you will need it each time you sign in</b></li>
<li>Enter your date of birth</li>
</ol>



<!--<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>contact your employer, where you have one, to make deductions from your pay</li>
<li>ask a debt collection agency to collect this money for us</li>
<li>Alternatively, you can set up a Direct Debit by contacting us on 0800 916 0647</li>
</ul>

<p>The amount we ask your employer to deduct will depend on what you earn and could be up to 20% of your earnings. However, if you have been prosecuted for a benefit fraud offence, this could rise to 40%.</p>

<p>Your employer may also charge you an administration fee; this will not exceed £1 for each payment deducted from your earnings.</p>-->
