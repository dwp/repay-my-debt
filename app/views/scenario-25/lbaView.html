<p>Dear Ashley Chamberlain</p>

<p>You owe outstanding amounts on debts to DFC Debt Management.</p>

<p>Total amount owed: <b>&pound;1500.00</b></p>

<p>Our new online service means you can view a breakdown and manage what you owe &ndash; you can pay in a way that suits you, either by Direct Debit, flexible payment plan or pay the full amount.</p>

<p>Next steps:</p>

<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
<li>Go to <a href="start">https://www.gov.uk/repay-my-debt</a></li>
<li><b>Enter security code 30054876254</b> &ndash; it is important to make a note of this as you may need it each time you sign in.</li>
<li>Enter your date of birth</li>
</ol>

<p>Alternatively, you can set up a Direct Debit by contacting us on the number above. If you don't do anything by <b>11/05/2021</b>, we will either:

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>contact your employer, where you have one, to make deductions from your pay</li>
<li>ask a debt collection agency to collect this money for us</li>
</ul>

<p>The amount we ask your employer to deduct will depend on what you earn and could be up to 20% of your earnings. However, if you have been prosecuted for a benefit fraud offence, this could rise to 40%.</p>

<p>Your employer may also charge you an administration fee; this will not exceed £1 for each payment deducted from your earnings.</p>

<p>The total amount does not include any Discretionary Support loans as you cannot repay them through this service. You should continue with your repayment and if you have cancelled it, we will contact you to arrange a new one.</p>
