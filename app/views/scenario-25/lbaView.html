<p>Dear Ashley Chamberlain</p>

<p>You owe outstanding amounts on debts to DFC Debt Management.</p>

<p>Total amount owed: <b>&pound;1500.00</b></p>


<p>Our new online service means you can view a breakdown of what you owe and pay in a way that suits you, either by Direct Debit, flexible payment plan or pay the full amount.</p>

<p>Next steps:</p>

<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
<li>Go to <a href="start">https://www.gov.uk/repay-my-debt</a></li>
<li><b>Enter security code 30054876254</b> &ndash; it is important to make a note of this as you may need it each time you sign in.</li>
<li>Enter your date of birth</li>
</ol>

<p>Alternatively, you can set up a Direct Debit by contacting us on the number above. If you don't do anything by <b>31/08/2021</b>, we will either:

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>contact your employer, where you have one, to make deductions from your pay</li>
<li>ask a debt collection agency to collect this money for us</li>
</ul>

<p>The amount we ask your employer to deduct will depend on what you earn and could be up to 20% of your earnings. However, if you have been prosecuted for a benefit fraud offence, this could rise to 40%.</p>

<p>Your employer may also charge you an administration fee; this will not exceed &pound;1 for each payment deducted from your earnings.</p>

<p><b>The total amount you owe does not include any Discretionary Support loans as you cannot repay them through this service.</b></p>

<p>You can get help dealing with money problems from NI Direct Government Services &ndash; www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/dealing-debt-problems</p>

<p>Yours sincerely</p>

<p>Mark Birtles<br>
Debt Centre Manager</p>
