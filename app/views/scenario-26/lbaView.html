<p>Dear Ashley Chamberlain</p>

<p>You owe outstanding amounts on debts to DWP Debt Management.</p>

<p>Total amount owed: <b>&pound;2160.00</b></p>


<p>Our new online service means you can view a breakdown of what you owe and pay in a way that suits you, either by Direct Debit, flexible payment plan or pay the full amount.</p>

<p>Next steps:</p>

<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
<li>Go to <a href="start">https://www.gov.uk/manage-my-benefit-debt</a></li>
<li>Register for the service &ndash; this will allow you to sign in securely using your email address and password.</li>
</ol>

<p>Alternatively, you can set up a Direct Debit by contacting us on the number above. If you don't do anything by <b>19/10/2021</b>, we will either:

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>contact your employer, where you have one, to make deductions from your pay</li>
<li>ask a debt collection agency to collect this money for us</li>
</ul>

<p>The amount we ask your employer to deduct will depend on what you earn and could be up to 20% of your earnings. However, if you have been prosecuted for a benefit fraud offence, this could rise to 40%.</p>

<p>Your employer may also charge you an administration fee; this will not exceed &pound;1 for each payment deducted from your earnings.</p>

<!--<p><b>The total amount you owe does not include any Discretionary Support loans as you cannot repay them through this service.</b></p>-->

<p>For help and support on dealing with debt and budgeting, contact:</p>
